// 01. Count the occurrences. 
// You are building a word count generator that will take a large string of text as input and output the words and
// the number of times they are present in the string. Your task is to write a function that can count the
// occurrences of each word in the string and return a Map containing each word's count. For simplicity, you can
// assume that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces.


function countWords(str) {
    const words = str.split(" ");
    const map = new Map();
  
    for (let word of words) {
      if (map.has(word)) {
        map.set(word, map.get(word) + 1);
      } else {
        map.set(word, 1);
      }

//   2. Only unique items are allowed.
//   You are building a program that takes an array of numbers as input and you need to remove all the duplicates
//   from the array. You want to write a function that can accomplish this task efficiently and returns a new set that
//   contains only the unique elements.


function UniqueElement(arr){

// 03. Swap the values.
// You are working on a project that requires you to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary
// variable. You decide to write a function that takes two variables as input and swaps their values using
// destructuring assignment with an array. The function should take the two variables as arguments, destructure
// them into an array, and then swap their positions within the array. Finally, the function should return an array
// with the swapped values. For example, if the function is called with the arguments x = 5 and y = 10, it should
// return an array [10, 5] with x now equal to 10 and y equal to 5.


function swap(a, b) {
    [a, b] = [b, a]
    return [a, b]
}

let x = 5

console.log(swap(x,y)) 



// 04. Access random elements.
// You are building a program that takes an array of numbers as input 
// and you need to extract the first, second, and last elements of the 
// array. You decide to write a function that can accomplish this task 
// using destructuring assignment with an array. The function should 
// take the array as an argument, destructure it into three variables 
// representing the first, second, and last elements, and then return an array 
// with these three values. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
//  the function should return an array [1, 2, 5].


function extract(arr) {
    const [first, second, , , , last] = arr;
    return [first, second, last];
  }
  
  const aray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  console.log(extract(aray));
  


// 5. Min and max values.
// You are building a program that needs to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers. You
// decide to write a function that can accomplish this task by taking an array of numbers as input and using the
// spread operator with the Math methods max() and min(). The function should return an object with two
// properties, max, and min, representing the maximum and minimum values in the input array, respectively. For
// example, if the input array is [5, 2, 7, 1, 9], the function should return an object { max: 9, min: 1 }.



function maxMin(arr) {
    return {
      max: Math.max(...arr),
      min: Math.min(...arr),
    };
  }
  
  const array = [3, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1];
  console.log(maxMin(array));
  



// 6. Nested Objects.
// Write a function that takes an object representing a person as input, and extracts the name and street
// properties from a nested object using object destructuring. The function should return an object with these two
// properties. 


const person = {
    name: "Mithun",
    age: 21,
    address: {
      street: "B8, Block B, Industrial Area.",
      city: "Sector 62, Noida",
      state: "Uttar Pradesh",
    },
  };
  
  function extractData(obj) {
    const {
      name,
      address: { street },
    } = obj;
    return { name, street };
  }
  
  console.log(extractData(person));
